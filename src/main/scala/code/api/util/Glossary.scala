			|## TL;DR
			|
			|Direct Login is a simple authentication process to be used at hackathons and trusted environments:
			|
			|
			|### 1) Get your App key
			|
			|[Sign up]($getServerUrl/user_mgt/sign_up) or [login]($getServerUrl/user_mgt/login) as a developer.
			|
			|Register your App key [HERE]($getServerUrl/consumer-registration)
			|
			|Copy and paste the consumer key for step two below.
			|
			|### 2) Authenticate
			|
			|
			|Using your favorite http client:
			|
			|	POST $getServerUrl/my/logins/direct
			|
			|Body
			|
			|	Leave Empty!
			|
			|
			|Headers:
			|
			|	Content-Type:  application/json
			|
			|
			|    Authorization: DirectLogin username="janeburel",
			|                    password="the-password-of-jane",
			|                    consumer_key="your-consumer-key-from-step-one"
			|
			|Here is it all together:
			|
			|	POST $getServerUrl/my/logins/direct HTTP/1.1
			|	Authorization: DirectLogin username="janeburel",   password="686876",  consumer_key="GET-YOUR-OWN-API-KEY-FROM-THE-OBP"

			|	Connection: close
			|	User-Agent: Paw/2.3.3 (Macintosh; OS X/10.11.3) GCDHTTPRequest
			|	Content-Length: 0
			|
			|
			|
			|
			|You should receive a token:
			|
			|	{"token":"a-long-token-string"}
			|
			|### 3) Make authenticated API calls
			|
			|In subsequent calls you can use the token received in step 2
			|
			|e.g.
			|
			|
			|Action:
			|
			|	PUT $getObpApiRoot/v2.0.0/banks/obp-bankx-n/accounts/my-new-account-id

			|	Content-Length: 60

			|### More information
			|
			|   Parameter names and values are case sensitive.
			|   The following parameters must be sent by the client to the server:
			|
			|       username
			|         The name of the user to authenticate.
			|
			|       password
			|         The password used to authenticate user. Alphanumeric string.
			|
			|       consumer_key
			|         The application identifier. Generated on OBP side via
			|         $getServerUrl/consumer-registration endpoint.
			|
			|
			|  Each parameter MUST NOT appear more than once per request.
